I am a _student_ who loves programming. My alias is Nandroid, because I started my love for programming through Android app development. I thought to add more info but my brain was eaten by a Zombie and a Vampire. 

**Some things which describes me:**

- 🔭 Placed at Cloud Maven.
- 🌱 I'm learning Flutter, React.
- 👯 II love collaborating with anyone. But I'm kinda shy.
- 💬 Ask me about Flutter, Dialogflow, Firebase, AWS, Salesforce and some stuff you might find interesting.
